Samsung Motion Data
===================

The function 'run_analysis()' generates takes the aggragate data 
subsets from the test and training classes for the Samsung LG motion 
data, assembles them together according to subject tested and 
activity performed and returns a tidy dataset of averages for 
various types of motion/orientation as functions of the above 
parameters.  The data set is also written to a tab-delimited '.txt' 
file named 'allsets_tidy.txt'. 

A code book explaining the variables is found in 'codebook.txt'.
